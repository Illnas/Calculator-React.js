React.js Calculator Project

This one one was not as hard, as it was annoying.
Each time I managed to update state it would either have too many zeros or too many dots.
If that was not a problem, then it would not have zeros or dots. And when I did manage to balance 
those two in perfect combination, the moment I would try to evaluate it, code would break.
So, instead of slamming my head against table, I decided to search how to solve this problem.
And I did find a solution, kinda! Code still breaks but at least it passes all 16 tests!

Which means, that when I do Calculator Project without freeCodeCamp restrictions, I should
have more space to fix code so that it works properly in all the cases, even those that are
not present in freecodecamp tests which I will use ONLY as guidelines! 

Anyway, I did notice that I focused too much on React Hooks and state manipulations
and I did not realise that this is tehnically easy project since it can be solved with 
few regex expressions and few if statements!

Well, beside hating Codepen, see ya in last project for freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries.
